resume_header_intro: "<p>This is Xinlong Wu(s3860954), a 3rd year Bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT University. I am from Inner Mongolia, China, which is a place with a strong animal husbandry industry as Australia. I have currently obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China. Due to the exchange between the two schools, I am currently enrolled in RMIT's Bachelor of Information Technology. This semester is my last semester at RMIT and I will graduate this year if all goes well.</p><p>Actually, I always maintain a sort of interest/curiosity in anything/activity if it's interesting, so just invite me if there's something fun to doÔºÅ</p><p>Besides that, my other biggest interest is IT & CS. I have a strong interest in how computers get up and running. I am currently an intern at a company focused on contributing to the Clang/LLVM open source compiler. Before that I also tried to implement a simple operating system, and I am currently designing a CPU by myself. They are all in my Github Repo.</p>"
