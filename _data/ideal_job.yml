  company: IBM
  job: <a target="_blank" href="https://xinlongwu-s3860954.github.io/XinlongWu/snapshot/">Front End Engineer</a>
  location: Sydney &bull; North Shore & Northern Beaches

  summary: This position requires focusing on the design and 
            implementation of web front-end engineering. 
            In other words, taking fantastic web pages 
            designed by designers and implementing them in code.

            They need someone who is familiar with front-end technology 
            and knows the basics of HTML & CSS & JS as well as the popular 
            front-end framework Angular, and because IBM is a large company, 
            they also need experience in dealing with front-end code size, 
            responsiveness and high level access issues. Finally, as a professional front-end engineer, 
            knowing how to deploy your own build environment or write your 
            own build scripts is an important skill, because no one else knows 
            how your system works but you.

            From my perspective, I think I have met many of the skills that they requires, 
            the rest of it is more about the lack of relevant experience. Firstly, I am 
            familiar with the basic usages of HTML/CSS/JS, and although I am relatively 
            new to Angular, I can get pretty good at using vue. js, another popular front-end 
            framework. I also maintain my own server to hold my various projects, so I am 
            familiar with linux shell scripting too. The only downside is that I really don't 
            have enough work experience. In other words, I don't have the skills to solve the 
            high level access issue they require.

            Their job description mentions the need for some work experience, which is what I
             am currently short of. I'm not sure if internship experience can be taken into 
             consideration, but I'm willing to take a chance. That would mean I would need to 
             find some front-end related internships. I believe that the solution to high 
             concurrency can also be learnt during the internship.
