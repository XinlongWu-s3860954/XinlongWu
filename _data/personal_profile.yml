summary: I was very impressed with the accuracy of the Myers-Briggs test. 
        It accurately pointed out most of my characteristics and also some of my weaknesses.
        As mentioned in the Myers-Briggs test and the DISC Personality test, 
        I have a good level of confidence in most things, and I also plan 
        for the worst case scenario. I consider myself to be a good leader 
        from this perspective. However, from my previous experience as a leader, 
        I would be very strict with the team members, which sometimes makes some 
        people feel uncomfortable. So I would be happy to be led by someone else, 
        but I will also be the first to step up if they are not a good leader.
