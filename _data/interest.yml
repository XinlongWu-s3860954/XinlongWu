  title: Game
  summary: I'm sure a lot of people are interested in IT because of the game, so am I.
          I was a Minecraft player before and it really is a great game, you can do 
          almost everything you want to do. If there's something it can't do, then 
          you can develop plugins for it. That' s why I got into java and I tried to use Java
           to develop plugins for it. And started a game server for my friends.

          The redstone system in the Minecraft game is also a very interesting thing, 
          it is very similar to real life circuits. Players can use redstone circuits to 
          make all sorts of machines and even computers.I have also used the Redstone system 
          to create the basic components of a computer in Minecraft - logic gates and registers

  title: Security
  summary: Who wouldn't want to be a hacker. Like in The Matrix, 
          hacking into computers and getting what you want. 
          But before that, I need to know something about 
          computer/information security. so I tried to understand the various attacks,
           buffer overflow attacks, DDOS, XSS, SQL injection etc.

  title: Web Page
  summary: I'm also interested in web design because I can easily see what I've done before, 
          just like painting. The web can be easy to start with, but it's not as easy as we think, 
          it can be tricky, as in this page

          . You You can click on the card to flip it over, but it's only implemented using HTML and CSS rather than JS.
          and I'm very happy with it.
