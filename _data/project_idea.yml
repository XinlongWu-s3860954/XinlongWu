# Project Idea

name: Spill (split bill)

section:
  - title: Overview
    description: This project aims to help international students, young people to better manage their spending.
                This project creates a mobile phone application for users to keep track of their spending, 
                manage their bank cards and even split their bills. The user can touch pay directly through 
                the bank card bound in the app. The payment details such as the purchase amount, time, what 
                was spent and the vendor are automatically recorded by the app at the same time as the payment.
  - title: Motivation
    description: Overseas students who live together usually buy household items together and the need to split 
                bills inevitably arises. At the same time, the teenagers also need to split bills when they hang 
                out together because of their lack of financial ability. In addition to that, bookkeeping is a pain 
                in the neck for many adults. Therefore, in order to provide a service to such a comprehensive and 
                large number of users. I have planned this software to help as many people as possible to keep track 
                of their accounts/split bills better
  - title: Description
    description: I have currently designed the following functions in my program：
                </br></br>
                <b>1. Managing bank cards/account：</b>Collaborate with various banks so that users can bind their bank cards 
                to our app. Just like Google Wallet/Apple pay. Users can see the details of their bank cards/gift cards 
                and even loyalty cards in one app.
                </br>
                <b>2. Pay bills via the app：</b> Also similar to Apple Pay, users can use touch on pay through the app to pay 
                for goods directly.
                </br>
                <b>3. Automatic accounting on successful payment：</b> When a user makes a successful payment through our app, 
                the app also records the user's transaction information and automatically logs it into the ledger.
                </br>
                <b>4. Split the bill：</b> users can register an account with our app and add their friends' accounts registered 
                in our app to a list like "contacts". Before paying, the user can choose who will split the bill with him. The 
                user has to pay the entire bill first when the payment is made. The app will send the same transaction information 
                to the other users who need to split the bill with them. And make sure they pay their portion of the bill to the 
                user who paid it. The application automatically accounts for each user who splits a bill and they can see the same 
                transaction history item.
                </br>
                <b>5. Track users' spending：</b> we also create daily/weekly or monthly statistics for users, which are also 
                categorised and marked for different purposes. Users can see directly from the chart how much they have spent in 
                the last period. This helps users to understand their spending status.
                </br>
                <b>6. Subscriber service：</b> In order for the application to operate properly, we need a certain source of income. 
                We will therefore also consider offering a better or more convenient service to our subscribers. For example, 
                because we are more concerned about the privacy of our users, all of our data will not be transmitted to the server. 
                This would then become troublesome for a subscriber who has multiple devices. We would therefore offer our subscribers 
                the ability to use encrypted cloud services. We encrypt the subscriber's data and upload it to the server so that when 
                one of the subscriber's devices pays a bill, the other devices of that subscriber will soon be synchronised with this 
                information.
                </br>
                <b>7. Backup：</b> Consider that some subscribers may not want to transfer data to a cloud server. We also offer an 
                alternative method of data synchronisation. Subscribers can export their book information to a file (an application-specific 
                data file or excel file) for saving or importing to another device.
  - title: Tools and Technologies
    description: I plan to develop applications, and it is likely that I will need to develop them separately for apple and android. 
                So I need to use java and swift to develop separately. However, my personal preference is to develop for apple as it 
                is a simpler tool to use. We need to use xcode on the Mac. We use git for versioning and github as our code repository.
  - title: Skills Required
    description: I was planning to develop a mobile application, so I needed to go through the general process of running a mobile 
                application (life cycle, graphic rendering principles) and the mobile application programming language (swift). 
                Fortunately, no special hardware facilities are required for the development of the software, just an iphone and 
                a mac would suffice. These are relatively easy to access. As for the software, xcode is an extremely large piece 
                of software that consumes a considerable amount of computer resources, which is our only concern.
  - title: Outcome
    description: If this project is successful, I hope it will try to replace Google Wallet. Because mind you, my app's functionality 
                is going to be redundant to Google Wallet's. Google Wallet is just a card pack that you can pay with. When people use 
                it to pay, they often don't realise they've spent money. This actually leads to a lot of people spending money on goods 
                and services that are not necessary. Our software, on the other hand, leaves a record for the user while spending. Thus 
                allowing users to spend their money more rationally, which I believe is why it will be popular.
