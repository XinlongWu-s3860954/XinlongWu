        <p>This is Xinlong Wu(s3860954), a 3rd year Bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT University. I am
          from Inner Mongolia, China, which is a place with a strong animal husbandry industry as Australia. I have
          currently obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China.
          Due to the exchange between the two schools, I am currently enrolled in RMIT's Bachelor of Information
          Technology. This semester is my last semester at RMIT and I will graduate this year if all goes well.</p>
        <p>Actually, I always maintain a sort of interest/curiosity in anything/activity if it's interesting, so just
          invite me if there's something fun to do！</p>
        <p>Besides that, my other biggest interest is IT & CS. I have a strong interest in how computers get up and
          running. I am currently an intern at a company focused on contributing to the Clang/LLVM open source compiler.
          Before that I also tried to implement a simple operating system, and I am currently designing a CPU by myself.
          They are all in my Github Repo.</p>

        <p class="resume-item-copy">As mentioned above, I have a great interest in IT. Therefore I am willing to learn
          as much as I can about it. So my current interest in IT covers a huge range. I will explain them all below</p>

      </div>

      <div class="resume-item" itemscope itemprop="worksFor" itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">

        <h3 class="resume-item-title" itemprop="name">Game</h3>



        <p class="resume-item-copy">I'm sure a lot of people are interested in IT because of the game, so am I. I was a
          Minecraft player before and it really is a great game, you can do almost everything you want to do. If there's
          something it can't do, then you can develop plugins for it. That' s why I got into java and I tried to use
          Java to develop plugins for it. And started a game server for my friends. 
        </br></br> The redstone system in
          the Minecraft game is also a very interesting thing, it is very similar to real life circuits. Players can use
          redstone circuits to make all sorts of machines and even computers.I have also used the Redstone system to
          create the basic components of a computer in Minecraft - logic gates and registers</p>

      </div>

      <div class="resume-item" itemscope itemprop="worksFor" itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">

        <h3 class="resume-item-title" itemprop="name">Security</h3>



        <p class="resume-item-copy">Who wouldn't want to be a hacker. Like in The Matrix, hacking into computers and
          getting what you want. But before that, I need to know something about computer/information security. so I
          tried to understand the various attacks, buffer overflow attacks, DDOS, XSS, SQL injection etc.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="resume-item" itemscope itemprop="worksFor" itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">

        <h3 class="resume-item-title" itemprop="name">Web Page</h3>



        <p class="resume-item-copy">I'm also interested in web design because I can easily see what I've done before,
          just like painting. The web can be easy to start with, but it's not as easy as we think, it can be tricky, as
          in this page <a target="_blank"
            href="https://codepen.io/fenglinger/full/zYqmWrK">https://codepen.io/fenglinger/full/zYqmWrK</a> . You You
          can click on the card to flip it over, but it's only implemented using HTML and CSS rather than JS. and I'm
          very happy with it.

          <p class="resume-item-copy">This position requires focusing on the design and implementation of web front-end
            engineering. In other words, taking fantastic web pages designed by designers and implementing them in code.
            
          </br></br> They need someone who is familiar with front-end technology and knows the basics of HTML & CSS &
            JS as well as the popular front-end framework Angular, and because IBM is a large company, they also need
            experience in dealing with front-end code size, responsiveness and high level access issues. Finally, as a
            professional front-end engineer, knowing how to deploy your own build environment or write your own build
            scripts is an important skill, because no one else knows how your system works but you. 
          </br></br> From my
            perspective, I think I have met many of the skills that they requires, the rest of it is more about the lack
            of relevant experience. Firstly, I am familiar with the basic usages of HTML/CSS/JS, and although I am
            relatively new to Angular, I can get pretty good at using vue. js, another popular front-end framework. I
            also maintain my own server to hold my various projects, so I am familiar with linux shell scripting too.
            The only downside is that I really don't have enough work experience. In other words, I don't have the
            skills to solve the high level access issue they require. 
          </br></br> Their job description mentions the need
            for some work experience, which is what I am currently short of. I'm not sure if internship experience can
            be taken into consideration, but I'm willing to take a chance. That would mean I would need to find some
            front-end related internships. I believe that the solution to high concurrency can also be learnt during the
            internship.</p>

        <p class="resume-item-copy">I was very impressed with the accuracy of the Myers-Briggs test. It accurately
          pointed out most of my characteristics and also some of my weaknesses. As mentioned in the Myers-Briggs test
          and the DISC Personality test, I have a good level of confidence in most things, and I also plan for the worst
          case scenario. I consider myself to be a good leader from this perspective. However, from my previous
          experience as a leader, I would be very strict with the team members, which sometimes makes some people feel
          uncomfortable. So I would be happy to be led by someone else, but I will also be the first to step up if they
          are not a good leader.</p>

      <h1 class="resume-item-details">Spill (split bill)</h1>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h2 class="resume-item-details">Overview</h2>
        <p class="resume-item-copy">This project aims to help international students, young people to better manage
          their spending. This project creates a mobile phone application for users to keep track of their spending,
          manage their bank cards and even split their bills. The user can touch pay directly through the bank card
          bound in the app. The payment details such as the purchase amount, time, what was spent and the vendor are
          automatically recorded by the app at the same time as the payment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h2 class="resume-item-details">Motivation</h2>
        <p class="resume-item-copy">Overseas students who live together usually buy household items together and the
          need to split bills inevitably arises. At the same time, the teenagers also need to split bills when they hang
          out together because of their lack of financial ability. In addition to that, bookkeeping is a pain in the
          neck for many adults. Therefore, in order to provide a service to such a comprehensive and large number of
          users. I have planned this software to help as many people as possible to keep track of their accounts/split
          bills better</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h2 class="resume-item-details">Description</h2>
        <p class="resume-item-copy">I have currently designed the following functions in my program： 

        </br></br> <b>1.
            Managing bank cards/account：</b>Collaborate with various banks so that users can bind their bank cards to
          our app. Just like Google Wallet/Apple pay. Users can see the details of their bank cards/gift cards and even
          loyalty cards in one app. 
        </br> <b>2. Pay bills via the app：</b> Also similar to Apple Pay, users can use
          touch on pay through the app to pay for goods directly. 
        </br> <b>3. Automatic accounting on successful
            payment：</b> When a user makes a successful payment through our app, the app also records the user's
          transaction information and automatically logs it into the ledger. 
        </br> <b>4. Split the bill：</b> users can
          register an account with our app and add their friends' accounts registered in our app to a list like
          "contacts". Before paying, the user can choose who will split the bill with him. The user has to pay the
          entire bill first when the payment is made. The app will send the same transaction information to the other
          users who need to split the bill with them. And make sure they pay their portion of the bill to the user who
          paid it. The application automatically accounts for each user who splits a bill and they can see the same
          transaction history item. 
        </br> <b>5. Track users' spending：</b> we also create daily/weekly or monthly
          statistics for users, which are also categorised and marked for different purposes. Users can see directly
          from the chart how much they have spent in the last period. This helps users to understand their spending
          status. 
        </br> <b>6. Subscriber service：</b> In order for the application to operate properly, we need a
          certain source of income. We will therefore also consider offering a better or more convenient service to our
          subscribers. For example, because we are more concerned about the privacy of our users, all of our data will
          not be transmitted to the server. This would then become troublesome for a subscriber who has multiple
          devices. We would therefore offer our subscribers the ability to use encrypted cloud services. We encrypt the
          subscriber's data and upload it to the server so that when one of the subscriber's devices pays a bill, the
          other devices of that subscriber will soon be synchronised with this information. 
        </br> <b>7. Backup：</b>
          Consider that some subscribers may not want to transfer data to a cloud server. We also offer an alternative
          method of data synchronisation. Subscribers can export their book information to a file (an
          application-specific data file or excel file) for saving or importing to another device.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h2 class="resume-item-details">Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p class="resume-item-copy">I plan to develop applications, and it is likely that I will need to develop them
          separately for apple and android. So I need to use java and swift to develop separately. However, my personal
          preference is to develop for apple as it is a simpler tool to use. We need to use xcode on the Mac. We use git
          for versioning and github as our code repository.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h2 class="resume-item-details">Skills Required</h2>
        <p class="resume-item-copy">I was planning to develop a mobile application, so I needed to go through the
          general process of running a mobile application (life cycle, graphic rendering principles) and the mobile
          application programming language (swift). Fortunately, no special hardware facilities are required for the
          development of the software, just an iphone and a mac would suffice. These are relatively easy to access. As
          for the software, xcode is an extremely large piece of software that consumes a considerable amount of
          computer resources, which is our only concern.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resume-item">
        <h2 class="resume-item-details">Outcome</h2>
        <p class="resume-item-copy">If this project is successful, I hope it will try to replace Google Wallet. Because
          mind you, my app's functionality is going to be redundant to Google Wallet's. Google Wallet is just a card
          pack that you can pay with. When people use it to pay, they often don't realise they've spent money. This
          actually leads to a lot of people spending money on goods and services that are not necessary. Our software,
          on the other hand, leaves a record for the user while spending. Thus allowing users to spend their money more
          rationally, which I believe is why it will be popular.</p>
